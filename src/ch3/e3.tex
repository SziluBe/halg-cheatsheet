\subsection{Polynomials}
\item Show that if $R$ is an integral domain then $R[X]^{\times} = R^{\times}$. Show by counter-example that this is false if $R$ is not an integral domain.
\item Show that the mapping $R[X] \mapsto \Maps(R, R)$ from def3.3.6 is not injective when $R = \mathbb{F}_{p}$, $p$ a prime. Hint: Fermat's Little Theorem. (This means that in general, even over fields, a polynomial is not just a special type of function!)
