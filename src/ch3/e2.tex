\subsection{Properties of Rings}
\item Let $p$ be a prime. Recall that in ex28 you showed that $\mathbb{F}_p^{\times}$, the group of units of the field $\mathbb{F}_p$, was an abelian group of order $p-1$; it was further remarked that Gauss at the age of 21 proved that $\mathbb{F}_p^{\times}$ was in fact cyclic. Prove that $\mathbb{F}_p^{\times}$ is cyclic.
