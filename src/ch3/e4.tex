\subsection{Homomorphisms, Ideals, and Subrings}
\item Let $R$ be a commutative ring and $\lambda \in R$. Show that the map $f : R[X] \rightarrow R$ defined by $f(P) = P(\lambda)$ for all $P \in R[X]$, as defined in def3.3.6, is a homomorphism.
\item Let $R$ be a commutative ring, $n$ a positive integer and $M \in \Mat(n; R)$. [Show that] The map $f : R[X] \rightarrow Mat(n;R)$ defined by
  $$
  f(a_tX^t + a_{t-1}X^{t-1} + \dots + a_1X + a_0) = a_tM^t + a_{t-1}M^{t-1} + \dots + a_1M + a_0
 $$
is a ring homomorphism.
\item \,[Show that] $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-1}] = \left\{ a + b \sqrt{-1} : a, b \in \mathbb{Z} \right\}$ is a subring of $\mathbb{C}$. This subring is called the ring of Gaussian integers. It is fundamental in elementary number theory.
