\subsection{Equivalence Relations}
\item Show that the relation $\approx$ on $\Mat(n \times m; F)$, defined by $A \approx B$ if there exist $P \in \GL(n;F)$ and $Q \in \GL(m;F)$ such that $B = PAQ$, is an equivalence relation.
\item Show that isomorphism is an equivalence relation on finite dimensional vector spaces over a field $F$.
\item Show that the $(n \times m)$ matrices over $F$ in SNF form a system of representatives for the equivalence relation of ex55.
\item Show that the set $\{F^n : n \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge0}\}$ is a system of representatives for the equivalence relation of ex56. show that $\{F[X]_n : n \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge0}\}$ is another system of representatives for the equivalence relation of ex56.
\item Define a relation $\sim$ on $\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$ by $(x, y) \sim (a, b) \Leftrightarrow x + b = y + a$.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Show that $\sim$ is an equivalence relation.
  \item Let $\bar{\mathbb{N}} = \mathbb{N} x \mathbb{N} / \sim$. Show that addition on $\mathbb{N}$ induces a well-defined addition on $\bar{\mathbb{N}}$.
  \item Show that with this addition, $\mathbf{\mathbb{N}}$ is an abelian group.
  \item Show that $\text{nat} : N \to \bar{\mathbb{N}}$ is an additive mapping where $\text{nat}(a) = E((a + n, n))$ for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$ (that is $\text{nat}(a + b) = \text{nat}(a) + \text{nat}(b)$).
  \item Show that $\bar{\mathbb{N}}$ is isomorphic as a group to $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$.
  \end{itemize}
