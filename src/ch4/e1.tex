\subsection{The Sign of a Permutation}
\item Show that the permutation that brings $i$ to the first place while changing the order of no other number has $i-1$ inversions. In particular, $\sgn(\sigma) = (-1)^{i-1}$. (Original notes has a diagram il)
\item Show that every permutation in $\mathfrak{S}_n$ can be described as a product of transpositions of neighbouring numbers, that is of the permutations $(i\;i+1)$ swapping $i$ and $i+1$ for some $1 \le i \le n-1$.
  
\item By adapting the argument in example 4.2.4 (see notes), show tha tthe determinant of a block-upper trianglar matrix $A$ with square blocks along the diagonal is the product of the determinants of the blocks along the diagonal ($\det (A) = \det (A_1) \det (A_2) \dots \det (A_t)$, where $A_i$ are the blocks along the diagonal of $A$).
