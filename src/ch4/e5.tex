\subsection{Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors}
\item Let $f : V \to V$ be an endomorphism of an $F$-vector space $V$. Show that $E(\lambda, f)$ is a subspace of $V$ for any $\lambda \in F$.
  
\item Let $F$ be a field and $A \in \Mat(n; F)$ a square matrix with coefficients in $F$. Show that the characteristic polynomial of $A$ has the form $\chi_A(x) = x^n - \tr(A)x^{n-1} + \dots \pm \det(A)$. Prosaically, we have  amonic polynomial whose next term has the trace of $A$ as its coefficient, and the constant term is $(-1)^n$ times the determinant of $A$.
  
\item Show that every endomorphism of an odd-dimensional real vector space has a real eigenvalue. Show furthermore that if the determinant of the endomorphism is a positive real number, then the endomorphism even has a positive real eigenvalue.
