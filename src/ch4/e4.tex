\subsection{Rules for Calculating with Determinants}
\item Recall from ex7 that a finite dimensional $\mathbb{C}$-vector space $V$ can be considered as an $\mathbb{R}$-vector space too, which I will denote $V_{\mathbb{R}}$. Let $f \in \Endo_{\mathbb{C}}(V)$ be an endomorphism of $V$ as a $\mathbb{C}$-vector space. Show that $f$ is also an endomorphism of $V_{\mathbb{R}}$ and that $\det(f|V_{\mathbb{R}}) = |\det(f|V)|^2$.
\item Big matrices, I'm sorry but I can be bothered writing them out. Please see the original notes.
  
\item Let $M = \bigl( \begin{smallmatrix} A & B \\ C & D \end{smallmatrix} \bigr)$ be a decomposition of $M$ with $A$ and $B$ square matrices. Assuming that $A$ is invertible, show that $|M| = |A||D-CA^{-1}B|$. Hence, or otherwise, show that if $X \in \Mat(m \times n, F)$ and $Y \in \Mat(n \times m, F)$ then $|1_m + XY| = |1_n + YX|$.
