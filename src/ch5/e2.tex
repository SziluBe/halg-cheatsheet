\subsection{Orthogonal Complements and Orthogonal Projections}
\item Show that in an inner product space $V$, $T^\bot$ is a subspace for any $T \subseteq V$. Show too that $T^\bot = \langle T \rangle^\bot$.
  
\item Prove that there is a unique orthonormal family whose elements satisfy the property displayed in the statement of thm5.2.7.
