# Honours Algebra Cheatsheet
![PDF Generation](https://github.com/9nine9nine9/halg-cheatsheet/actions/workflows/blank.yml/badge.svg)

A cheatsheet for the Honours Algebra course by SoM@UoE

Contains (pretty much, save for some repeats) every theorem, proposition, lemma, corollary, and definition from the course notes. A separate PDF is generated containing all exercises.

This misses any content that was not examinable in 2023. Namely, the PageRank sections, section 3.7 on modules, and the latter half of 3.5 on the spectral theorem. Exercises from 5.3 onwards are also missing.

Latest versions can be found in the Releases tab (or [here](https://github.com/9nine9nine9/halg-cheatsheet/releases/download/latest/main.pdf) for the theorems, and [here](https://github.com/9nine9nine9/halg-cheatsheet/releases/download/latest/exercises.pdf) for the exercises).
